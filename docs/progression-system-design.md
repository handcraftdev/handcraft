# Rock Paper Scissors Progression System with Resource Management

This document outlines a comprehensive progression system built around rock-paper-scissors with resource management elements, designed to enhance player engagement and longevity.

## Core Concept: The Elemental Academy

Players join an academy to master the three elemental powers: Earth (Rock), Wind (Paper), and Blade (Scissors). The game revolves around collecting, crafting, and strategic deployment of these elements.

## Resource Systems

### 1. **Elemental Essences**
- **Rock Essence**: Harvested from victories using Rock
- **Paper Essence**: Harvested from victories using Paper
- **Scissors Essence**: Harvested from victories using Scissors
- Players earn more essence when winning with their weaker elements, encouraging diverse play

### 2. **Energy System (Already Implemented)**
- Keep the existing energy system, but expand its role
- Energy can be converted to essences at a cost
- Special "elemental harmonization" lets players convert between essence types

### 3. **Prestige Resources**
- **Harmonic Crystals**: Earned rarely from perfect streaks
- **Elemental Cores**: Weekly rewards based on performance
- **Master Tokens**: Achievement rewards for mastering specific strategies

## Progression Paths

### 1. **Elemental Mastery Trees**
- Each element (Rock/Paper/Scissors) has its own mastery tree
- Players invest essences to unlock:
  - **Enhanced Moves**: Special versions of basic moves with bonuses
  - **Combo Potential**: Ability to chain moves across rounds
  - **Expertise Perks**: Passive bonuses when using specific elements

### 2. **Academy Ranking System**
- Players progress through ranks (Novice → Adept → Expert → Master → Grandmaster)
- Each rank unlocks new customization options
- Higher ranks give better rewards but face tougher opponents

### 3. **Seasonal Challenges**
- Monthly tournaments with themed requirements
- Special resource rewards that can't be obtained elsewhere
- Leaderboards with exclusive cosmetic rewards

## Strategic Gameplay Elements

### 1. **Elemental Combos**
- Winning with the same move multiple times charges that element
- Charged elements provide boosted rewards
- BUT opponents can detect patterns and counter more effectively

### 2. **Elemental Fusion**
- Combine essences to create hybrid moves with special properties
- Example: "Reinforced Paper" (Rock+Paper) is stronger against Scissors
- Create strategic advantage by investing in specific combinations

### 3. **Move Preparation**
- Players can "prepare" moves beforehand using essences
- Prepared moves yield better rewards but telegraph intentions
- Risk/reward mechanics encourage strategic thinking

## Economic Loop

### 1. **Collection Cycle**
1. Play matches to earn elemental essences
2. Use essences to enhance elemental mastery
3. Higher mastery yields more essences per victory
4. Invest in strategic advantages

### 2. **Conversion Economy**
- Converting between resource types always has a cost
- Strategic decisions about which elements to prioritize
- Premium resources can't be directly purchased, only earned

### 3. **Time Management**
- Energy recharges over time (already implemented)
- Daily/weekly quests for bonus resources
- Seasonal events introduce limited-time resources

## Visual Progression

### 1. **Elemental Auras**
- Visual effects that grow more impressive as players master elements
- Auras reflect primary playstyle (favored element)
- Unlock color variations through achievements

### 2. **Academy Badges**
- Visible emblems that show mastery levels in each element
- Special achievement badges for unique playstyles
- Seasonal badges for participation in events

### 3. **Arena Customization**
- Unlock themed arenas that provide minor gameplay bonuses
- Visual progression shows accomplishment level

## Real-World Tie-ins

### 1. **Daily Challenge System**
- Daily challenges that require specific moves or strategies
- Bonus resources for completing streaks of daily challenges
- "Prime time" periods with enhanced rewards

### 2. **Friend Challenges**
- Challenge friends to themed matches
- Share resources with friends (with limits)
- Cooperative challenges for group rewards

### 3. **Community Goals**
- Server-wide goals that all players contribute toward
- Resource bonuses when community milestones are reached

## Technology Implementation Considerations

### Database Structure
- Player profiles track:
  - Resource quantities
  - Elemental mastery levels
  - Achievement progression
  - Current seasonal stats

### Game Balance
- Tiered progression keeps new players competitive
- Strategic depth increases at higher levels
- Multiple viable paths to advancement

### Monetization Potential (Optional)
- Cosmetic upgrades only (no gameplay advantage)
- Battle pass with extra daily challenges
- Convenience features (faster energy regeneration)

## Conclusion

This progression system transforms a simple Rock Paper Scissors game into a strategic resource management experience while maintaining the core gameplay. Players have meaningful choices about resource allocation, strategic specialization, and long-term progression goals.

The system rewards both casual players (through daily activities and gradual accumulation) and dedicated players (through mastery and optimization), creating an engaging experience that extends the lifespan of the game significantly.
